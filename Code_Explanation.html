It is possible that Instagram may block your IP address if it detects that you are scraping its website without permission. This can happen if you make too many requests in a short period of time, or if you use an easily detectable scraping method.

It is important to be mindful of the terms of service of any website you interact with and to obtain permission before downloading or scraping any content. Most websites will have a limit on how many requests you can make within a certain timeframe. If you exceed this limit, your IP address may be blocked.

To avoid getting your IP address blocked, you should use a technique called "web scraping with a delay" where you add a certain delay between requests. This makes your scraping less detectable and reduces the likelihood of your IP address being blocked.

Another way to prevent your IP from getting blocked is by using a proxy or a VPN service which will let you access the website from a different IP.

It's also important to note that scraping Instagram without permission can be against their terms of service and can lead to legal issues.

I would recommend not to scrape Instagram's website without permission and to look for other ways to obtain the data you need.
